# JavaScript ES6-playlist log

### Day 6: September 2, 2017    

**Today's Progress**:   
1. Today I learnt about the spread operator.  
2. Template string `console.log(`my name is ${name} and my age is ${10+9}`);
3. Object Literal Enhancemnts  
4. New Strings methods
5. Arrow Functions

**Thoughts**:     
1.  If you use the arrow function, you don't lose the scope of the variables. You don't need to create a reference to the variable (_this) to keep the scope
